- Enable users to explore and filter data to gain specific insights.

Target Audience: The dashboard is designed for a broad audience, including:
- Sales managers
- Marketing teams
- E-commerce business owners
- Analysts

  2. Skills Demonstrated

This project showcases the following data analyst skills:
- Data Visualization: Creating effective and interactive visualizations using Power BI to communicate sales data insights.
- Data Analysis: Analyzing sales data to identify trends, patterns, and key drivers of sales performance.
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Utilizing DAX to create calculated columns and measures for in-depth sales analysis (e.g., month-over-month growth, sales by gender, sales by age group).
- Data Interpretation: Interpreting the visualized data to provide meaningful insights and actionable recommendations.
- Dashboard Design: Designing a user-friendly and intuitive dashboard layout for easy navigation and data exploration.
- Data Cleaning and Transformation: Preparing the data for analysis, including cleaning, transforming, and loading it into Power BI.

3. Project Details
- Tools Used:
- Power BI Desktop: For data connection, modeling, DAX calculations, and dashboard creation.
- Data Sources: 
Sample e-commerce sales data, which includes customer information (gender, age), sales transactions (sales amount, quantity, date), and product details (category).

Key Metrics Analyzed:
- Total Sales
- Month-over-Month Sales Growth
- Quantity Sold
- Month-over-Month Quantity Growth
- Sales by Product Category
- Sales by Gender
- Sales by Age Group
- Sales by Day of the Week

Visualizations Created: 
- KPI cards to display key sales metrics and growth rates.
- Bar charts to visualize sales by product category, gender, and age group.
- Line charts to show sales trends by day of the week.
- Tables to display detailed sales data, including MoM growth for different categories.
- Donut chart to visualize sales by gender.

4. Data Preparation (If Applicable)

(Include this section if you performed data cleaning or transformation steps using Power Query or other tools. If these steps were extensive, create a separate file and link to it)

Data Cleaning: (Describe cleaning steps. Example below)

Handled missing values in customer demographic data.

Ensured data consistency in date formats.

Data Transformation: (Describe transformations. Example below)

Calculated month-over-month sales and quantity growth.

Categorized customers into age groups (Gen Z, Gen X, Millennials, Baby Boomers).

Data Loading: (Describe how data was loaded into Power BI)
* The cleaned and transformed data was loaded into Power BI Desktop using the "Get Data" functionality.

5. Dashboard Highlights
- Sales Performance Overview: Provides a high-level overview of total sales and growth trends.
- Product Category Analysis: Visualizes sales performance across different product categories.
- Customer Segmentation: Analyzes sales by gender and age group to understand customer demographics.
- Trend Analysis: Identifies sales patterns throughout the week.
- Detailed Sales Breakdown: Provides a table with a detailed breakdown of sales, quantity, and MoM growth by gender and category.
- Interactive Filtering: Month name slicer allows users to dynamically filter the data.

6. Challenges and Solutions
- Challenge:Handling inconsistent date formats in the sales data.
  Solution: Used Power Query to standardize the date format to ensure accurate time-based analysis.
- Challenge:Calculating accurate month-over-month growth rates for different product categories and customer segments.
  Solution: Utilized DAX measures with appropriate filtering and date functions to calculate accurate MoM growth.

7. Future Enhancements
Incorporate predictive analytics to forecast future sales trends.
Implement customer segmentation based on purchase behavior.
Integrate data from other sources, such as marketing campaigns and website analytics.
Develop a mobile-friendly version of the dashboard.
Add more detailed information about shipping costs and delivery times using power automate 

8. Conclusion

This project demonstrates the ability to develop a comprehensive and interactive dashboard for analyzing e-commerce sales data. The dashboard provides valuable insights for understanding sales performance, customer behavior, and product category trends. This project highlights skills in data visualization, DAX calculations, and dashboard design, making it a valuable addition to a data analytics portfolio.
